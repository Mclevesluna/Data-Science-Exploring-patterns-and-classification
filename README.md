# Data Science Project: Exploring patterns and classifications in 4 data sets

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the types of variables and data within four datasets, identifying relationships, patterns, and potential classification problems. To accomplish this, a series of steps to determine data/variable types, identify linearity and patterns, and explore classification problems were followed. For specific datasets, models such as decision trees, multiple regressions, and KNN predictors were also explored.

## Dataset
Data sets for this project are in folder titled "data" and were provided by Creative Computing Institute at University of the Art London (2023). 

## Preferred Language
Python

## Project Tasks

### 1. Dataset Analysis
- **Objective**: Identify the type of each dataset and determine possible tasks.
- **Steps**:
  - **Dataset Type Identification**:
    - Determine if the dataset is Linear/NonLinear and Single/Multilabel.
    - Identify whether the tasks possible are Classification or Regression.
  - **Justification**:
    - **Variable Type Inspection**: Examine the dataset and report on the types of variables based on domain knowledge.
    - **Exploratory Analysis**: Perform at least one exploratory analysis technique (e.g., descriptive statistics, visualizations).
    - **Inferential Analysis**: Conduct one inferential analysis technique (e.g., hypothesis testing, confidence intervals).
    - **Predictive Analysis**: Apply one predictive analysis technique (e.g., regression model, classification algorithm).

### 2. Application of Loss Functions
- **Objective**: Apply various loss functions to appropriate datasets and compare their effectiveness.
- **Steps**:
  - **Loss Function Application**:
    - Apply the following loss functions as applicable:
      - L1 loss
      - L2 loss
      - Log loss
      - Categorical cross-entropy loss
      - Hinge loss
  - **Comparison**:
    - Create visual plots to compare the performance of different loss functions where applicable.

### 3. Metric Assessment
- **Objective**: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Steps**:
  - **Metrics Evaluation**:
    - For Classification: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix.
    - For Regression: Use metrics such as RÂ² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE).
  - **Documentation**:
    - Record and interpret the metrics for each dataset.

### 4. Non-Linear Dataset Transformation
- **Objective**: Transform a non-linear dataset to linear space and assess model performance.
- **Steps**:
  - **Kernel Transformation**:
    - Choose a non-linear dataset and apply a kernel transformation to linear space (e.g., Polynomial Kernel, Radial Basis Function).
  - **Model Fitting**:
    - Fit a model to the transformed data and evaluate its accuracy.

### 5. Regression Overfitting Analysis
- **Objective**: Create and analyze overfitting scenarios in regression.
- **Scenario**:
  - **Overfitting Creation**:
    - Adjust feature subsets or training dataset size to create overfitting conditions.
  - **Evidence**:
    - Use metrics and plots to demonstrate overfitting.
  - **Regularization**:
    - Apply two regularization methods (e.g., L1 regularization, L2 regularization) and evaluate model performance before and after regularization.

### 6. Classification Overfitting Analysis
- **Objective**: Create and analyze overfitting scenarios in classification.
- **Scenario**:
  - **Overfitting Creation**:
    - Adjust feature subsets or training dataset size to create overfitting conditions.
  - **Evidence**:
    - Use metrics and plots to demonstrate overfitting.
  - **Regularization**:
    - Apply two regularization methods (e.g., Dropout, L2 regularization) and evaluate model performance before and after regularization.

### 7. Decision Tree Analysis
- **Objective**: Apply Decision Tree models to specific datasets.
- **Steps**:
  - **Decision Tree Application**:
    - Apply a Decision Tree model to the following datasets:
      - MASTER_PhonesmartdataAll_CCI_AdvStats.csv
      - wine dataset
  - **Pruning**:
    - Apply pruning techniques to the Decision Tree models and record observations.
